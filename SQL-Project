SQL PROJECT

Create a database schema to store the following information:	
1 = *table* Product information (such as name, description, price, and quantity in stock)
#  A column must be defined as NOT NULL if it is a primary key
CREATE TABLE Product_Info 
(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    names VARCHAR (30),
    descriptions VARCHAR (30),
    price FLOAT,
    quantity_in_stock INT
);


2 = Customer information (such as name, email, and shipping address)	
#  A column must be defined as NOT NULL if it is a primary key
CREATE TABLE Customer_information 
(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    Cust_Name VARCHAR (30),
    email VARCHAR (30),
    shipping_address VARCHAR
 );


3 = Order information (such as the products ordered, the quantity of each product, and the total cost of the order)	
#  A column must be defined as NOT NULL if it is a primary key
CREATE TABLE Order_Info 
(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    products_ordered VARCHAR (30),
    quantity_of_product INT,
    total_cost_ofd_order FLOAT
);


Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks:	
1 = Add a new product to the database
# cowboots are the new product
INSERT INTO Product_Info (id, names, descriptions, price, quantity_in_stock)
VALUES
(10, ‘cowboots’, ‘animal_clothes’, 30.21, 100);	


2 = Update the quantity of a product in stock	
UPDATE Product_Info
SET quantity_in_stock = 100
WHERE id = 7;


3 = Retrieve a list of all products in stock
# names is the “products” / you can go straight into a column/list 
SELECT names
FROM Product_Info;	


4 = Retrieve a list of all orders for a specific customer
### practice this one###
SELECT quantity_of_product	
FROM Order_Info	
WHERE id = 2;	


5 = Calculate the total sales for a given time period (e.g. the past month)
### practice this one###
SELECT SUM (total_cost_ofd_order)
FROM Order_Info
WHERE id IN (1, 2);
